## <a name="synopsis"> Synopsis
The idea is to give the event creators a blank slate to promote themselves and their
events.
- Home page shows a list of event creators (around 5) are registered on the app
and a list of events. Clicking on the event creator opens the profile page and
clicking on the event shows the details and the possibility to register for the
event
- Once the user clicks on Sign Up to become a partner they will have:
o Customizable profile page (or tab)
- Personal Information (Name/Age/Description etc.)
- Photos and Videos
- Any other thing that you think will be interesting to add to an
event creator profile page
- The layout of the page can be fixed but extra point if it is a drag
and drop template where the user can move the blocks as
needed or add new blocks to customize the page

o Event Page (or tab)
- Create Event
- Use any form layout with fields of your choice
- Both for paid and free events
- Modify/edit/delete event
- List of the events proposed/created (choose your layout)
- Once the profile is created it should show up on the home page (creator profile
and the events proposed by them)
- Feel free to add any other functionalities if you want
- Implement the assignment using any language or framework you feel
comfortable with (Lomads is a Mobile first app)
